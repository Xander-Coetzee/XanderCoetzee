My personal website. 

My thought process as I was developing the website: 


Hosting: The website is likely hosted on a static web hosting platform, suitable for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. Given the structure of your site, it could be hosted on platforms like GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel, which are ideal for static websites.

Innovation: Your website incorporates several innovative features:

Interactive skill display with hover effects showing proficiency levels
Animated titles and subtitles on hover for enhanced user engagement
Smooth page transitions with fade effects for a seamless browsing experience
Clickable email address that copies to clipboard for easy user interaction
Web Technologies: The website utilizes the following web technologies:

HTML5 for structure
CSS3 for styling, including flexbox for layout
JavaScript for interactivity and dynamic content
Font Awesome for icons
Google Fonts for typography
Compatibility: The website is designed to be compatible with modern web browsers. The use of standard HTML, CSS, and JavaScript ensures broad compatibility across desktop and mobile devices.

Navigation: The site features a clean and intuitive navigation system:

Consistent top navigation bar across all pages
Links to Home, Resume, Contact, and CV download
Social media links (LinkedIn and GitHub) integrated into the design
Smooth transitions between pages for a fluid user experience
